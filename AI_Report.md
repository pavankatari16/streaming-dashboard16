# AI Usage Report

This assignment was completed with standard development tools:

- GitHub Codespaces
- GitHub Copilot (for boilerplate and repetitive UI patterns)

AI assistance was used for:

- Generating Tailwind utility patterns
- Creating initial skeleton components
- Minor TypeScript typings

All application logic, API integration, routing structure, and final adjustments were implemented manually.
