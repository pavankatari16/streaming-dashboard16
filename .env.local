Progress update: I committed and pushed the changes to main, created .gitignore, and started installing dependencies and running the dev server in the background. I'll report back when the dev server is ready or if there are runtime errors.

What you can do now locally

Open the app at http://localhost:3000 once the dev server starts.
If you want me to stop the dev server or run it in the foreground instead, tell me and I’ll adjust.
I'll watch the terminal and post the server ready URL or any errors as soon as they appear.
