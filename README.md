## AI Usage Report

This assignment was completed with the assistance of standard development tools such as:

- GitHub Codespaces
- GitHub Copilot (used for boilerplate and repetitive UI patterns)

AI assistance was mainly used for:

- Generating Tailwind utility patterns
- Creating initial skeleton components
